conditions
==========

Simple runtime conditions classes for java written in groovy.

This library implements a simple DSL to help support [Design by Contract], similar 
to [guava's Preconditions class] or [Microsoft Research's Code Contracts] library.

[Design by Contract]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract
[guava's Preconditions class]: https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/PreconditionsExplained
[Microsoft Research's Code Contracts]: http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/contracts/

Some examples need to live here... Check out the unit tests!

contracts uses Travis CI for [builds](https://travis-ci.org/tlrasor/conditions)
